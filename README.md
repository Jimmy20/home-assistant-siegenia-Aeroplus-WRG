# Siegenia for Home Assistant

A Home Assistant integration to control and monitor Siegenia Aeroplus WRG smart ventilation devices with Co2 sensor.
Vibe coded, based on the awesome work for iobroker here: https://github.com/Apollon77/ioBroker.siegenia 

Tested with 4 Aeroplus WRG modules. Other siegenia devices might work, untested.

## Power switch (AEROMAT VT)

Fork of [Darklirah/home-assistant-siegenia-Aeroplus-WRG](https://github.com/Darklirah/home-assistant-siegenia-Aeroplus-WRG)
that adds the one control that was missing: switching the whole unit **on and off**,
like the power button in the SIEGENIA Comfort app. Written for the
**AEROMAT VT (WRG)**.

- **New `Power` switch.** The Siegenia API has a single master flag for this,
  `devicestate.deviceactive`, written as
  `setDeviceParams {"devicestate": {"deviceactive": false}}` (the same parameter the
  [ioBroker adapter](https://github.com/Apollon77/ioBroker.siegenia) exposes as
  `params.active`). The integration never sent it, so the unit could only be
  throttled to `fanpower: 0`, not switched off. The switch is created only when the
  device reports `deviceactive` (in `getDeviceState` or `getDeviceParams`). It is the
  device's main entity, so Home Assistant shows it under the device name and lists
  it first on the device page.
- **`fan.turn_off` / `fan.turn_on` use the same flag** on devices that report it.
  Turning off keeps fan power and mode untouched, so turning on resumes where the
  unit left off. Devices without `deviceactive` keep the previous behaviour.

### Install from this fork via HACS

1. If the Darklirah fork is installed: HACS → *Siegenia (AEROVITAL + Aeroplus fork)*
   → ⋮ → **Remove**. Do **not** delete the integration under *Settings → Devices &
   services*; the configuration and entities are kept.
2. HACS → ⋮ → **Custom repositories** → add
   `https://github.com/Jimmy20/home-assistant-siegenia-Aeroplus-WRG`, type
   *Integration* → download.
3. Restart Home Assistant. The power switch appears at the top of the device page,
   under the device's name.

## About this fork

Fork of [rikbootsman/home-assistant-siegenia-Aeroplus-WRG](https://github.com/rikbootsman/home-assistant-siegenia-Aeroplus-WRG),
extended for the **AEROVITAL ambience** (device type 5, tested with software
1.7.7 / hardware 1.34). Aeroplus behaviour is unchanged — every difference is
guarded by what the device actually reports.

What is fixed here:

- **Fan and airflow now belong to the device.** `fan.py` and `number.py` did not
  declare `device_info`, so both entities ended up with `device_id: null` and were
  missing from the device page. On an AEROVITAL those are the only two controls,
  which made the integration look read-only.
- **`fan.turn_on` no longer raises a TypeError.** This one hit every device:
  Home Assistant calls `async_turn_on(percentage, preset_mode, **kwargs)` with
  positional arguments, while the method was declared as `(self, **kwargs)`. The
  service call died with `TypeError: takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given`
  before anything was sent to the device. Both are named parameters now.
- **On/off works on devices without a power parameter.** An AEROVITAL has no
  `power` / `on` / `enabled` — it runs whenever `fanpower > 0`. `turn_on` sent only
  those three keys, which the device accepts and ignores. `turn_off` worked by
  accident via `fanpower: 0`, but auto mode ramped the fan straight back up. Both
  now check whether the device reports a power parameter and fall back to
  `fanpower` (plus `automode: false`) when it does not.
- **The raw state sensor no longer floods the log.** It put the whole device dump
  into its state, which Home Assistant caps at 255 characters — an ERROR on every
  update, about 8600 a day. The state is now the number of reported parameters and
  the JSON moved to a `raw` attribute.

Added here:

- **The settings the SIEGENIA Comfort app offers, as entities.** Everything below
  was verified against the app side by side with the raw device parameters:

  | App | Entity | Parameter |
  |---|---|---|
  | Betriebsart (operating mode) | `select` | `fanmode` — `IN` / `OUT` / `IN_OUT` / `IN_OUT_WRG` |
  | Sensorempfindlichkeit | `number` (%) | `automode_co2sensity` |
  | Maximale Gebläseleistung (auto mode) | `number` (m³/h) | `automode_maxairflow` |
  | Silent Mode | `switch` | `ecomode` |
  | Maximale Gebläseleistung (silent mode) | `number` (m³/h) | `ecomode_maxairflow` |
  | Timer Silent Mode | `switch` | `ecotimer` |
  | Einschaltzeit / Ausschaltzeit | `time` | `ecomode_start` / `ecomode_end` |
  | Warnungen | `sensor` | `warnings` |

  Two encodings worth knowing, both confirmed against the app: the two airflow
  caps are **percentages of `maxfanpower`**, not m³/h (the app showed 43 m³/h for
  `ecomode_maxairflow: 71` with `maxfanpower: 60`), and the silent mode times count
  **quarter hours since midnight** (`88` is 22:00, `24` is 6:00). Every one of
  these entities is only created when the device reports the parameter.

- **Operating hours and remaining filter life.** The app shows both under
  *Weitere Einstellungen*, but they are not in `getDeviceParams` — they come from
  **`getDeviceDetails`**, a command the integration never called. That response is
  now part of every coordinator update and yields two sensors:
  `operatinghours` (h) and `airfilterremainingterm` (days until the filter is
  due). It also carries `ip`, `mac` and the firmware versions, which the raw state
  sensor now includes.

- **Climate readings now carry a device class and `state_class: measurement`**, so
  temperature and humidity get the right icon and formatting and Home Assistant
  keeps long term statistics for them.

- **A `Sync Clock` button.** The devices keep their own clock and the eco timer
  runs on it. The unit tested here was observed five minutes behind Home Assistant
  at one point and back in step an hour later, so it may or may not correct itself
  — there was simply no way to see or fix the offset from Home Assistant. The
  button writes local time to the device and exposes the device's own clock as a
  `device_clock` attribute, so the offset is visible without pressing anything. It
  only appears when the device actually reports a `clock`.

Notes on the AEROVITAL: it reports no CO₂ ppm value (only the `airquality` index),
so that sensor stays absent. Every request needs an `id` field or the device
answers `{"id":-1,"status":"incorrect_format"}`. A non-admin account is enough to
write parameters, and unknown keys are accepted silently.
